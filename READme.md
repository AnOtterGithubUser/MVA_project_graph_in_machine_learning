# MVA 2016/2017
Course: Graphs in Machine Learning, by Michal VALKO  
This was a project to validate the course. The aim was to implement understand and implement several optimization algorithms from the litterature in a combinatorial semi bandit setting and to test and compare these on diverse issues.
